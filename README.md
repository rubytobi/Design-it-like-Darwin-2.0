# Design-it-like-Darwin-2.0
**Abstract.** Process redesign is an important and valuable phase of the business process management (BPM) lifecycle. However, human creativity and objectiveness regarding continuous redesign initiatives are limited and biased. To overcome these limitations, we propose computational support based on evolutionary algorithms. Our software tool extends a formerly published proof of concept. Novelties have been introduced by including a new data structure, new mutation and crossover operators as well as an extended evaluation of unambiguous process designs explicitly considering time objectives. Finally, the tool provides new computation process (re-)design support to the BPM community.
